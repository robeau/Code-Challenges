This was my first time using node.js, socket.io, express, and jade. I used a very basic
tutorial to get the chat server and client up, and from there I was able to mess
around and get the hang of how it all works and add the rest of the features.

Next steps would be adding a list of who's online, and notifying the board when 
someone joins.

Running the app
==============================
To run the app you will need to have node.js, express, and jade installed. The
node_modules folder had to be removed in order to send the app over email. 

C:\code-challenges> node server.js
